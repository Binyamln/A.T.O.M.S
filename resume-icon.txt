Note: To use the build script as intended, create a 256x256 icon file named "resume-icon.ico" in this directory. 

You can create such an icon using online icon generators or tools like GIMP or Photoshop.

If you don't have an icon file, you can modify the build.bat script to remove the --icon parameter.
